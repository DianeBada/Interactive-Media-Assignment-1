        The term interactivity can be described as the process of allowing information to be passed with no breaks in both directions between a computer/device and the person who uses it. This term derived from the Oxford dictionary describes the usual occurrence that everyone goes through today. Interactivity is always taking place, whether we are posting on social media, watching a music video on YouTube, or just simply interacting with the internet.    <br>
    <p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I think back to high school where we were assigned to create websites that reflected ourselves, from hobbies to family to achievements, similar to what we’re doing now. My website was static and had no element of interactivity. All one could do was click on different links that led to different pages. Nothing special. This links back to how the web used to be back then, with Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. These were static and read-only websites. Then the web slowly developed and Web 3.0 and with this, it introduced some dynamic elements, provision of information, and the analysis of data according to the user’s data, such as how related information will find you based on your search history.        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            So, how does interactivity work on the WWW?
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of web design, the web is meant to attract users and entice them to engage with the page. An example of interactive elements found on the web are things like radio buttons, hyperlinks, etc. Also, giving users choice and agency in how they navigate the website, also allows for interactivity. But why should developers care about interactivity? When users interact with the web, they want things to be straightforward and simple. Interactivity allows users to personalize their experience through the submission of their data. It allows for users to keep coming back and allows for easy capture of the user experience.        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I personally think interactivity is essential, especially in this fast-paced world. I would never really visit a site if I knew that my first experience with it was tedious and boring. As humans, we like being kept on our toes and like feeling like we have been heard. The web is constantly evolving and hence we should be able to handle even though it is, we are still catered for and not left behind. That’s why it is important to always evaluate one’s page. Does it still accommodate for users’ experience and still make users feel as if they are given the choices?        </p>
